# Solution
We are given a PDF file that has a couple instances of redacted text. If text is redacted improperly you can still recover it. For instance if you just select the lines that are blacked out and copy and past it to another file the text will be shown.

However for this challenge the blacked out text are just misdirections the real redacted text is a string located at the bottom of the document that was whited out.
